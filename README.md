## What is Hypercore?

The Hypercore Protocol is an open-source, peer-to-peer technology stack that allows people to connect and share data seamlessly across the planet, all without servers.  For the past five years, we've been building toward a future where anyone can build scalable, data-intensive businesses, such as search engines, video chat apps, and social networks, directly from their homes and with minimal barriers to entry. We're a tiny, Copenhagen-based team, but you can be located anywhere!
